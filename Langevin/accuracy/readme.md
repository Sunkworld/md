# Description
- The calculation of accuracy for physical part of eight methods `ABAO ABOBA BABO BAOAB OABA OABAO OBAB OBABO` is done with parameters:
```fortran
eqtime = 1d7
tstime = 1d7
```

- The unphysical part is done with parameters:
```fortran
eqtime = 3d7
tstime = 1d7
```

- The calculation of four methods `SAS ASA BKB KBK` is done with parameters:
```fortran
eqtime = 2d7
tstime = 1d7
```
