# Description
The harmonic result is mainly obtained by *typical* method, with parameters:
```fortran
eqstep = 2.5e7
tsstep = 1e7
```fortran
the last 2e6 steps for calculation of correlation time.

Some of the results, specifically
```fortran
dt = 0.05
gamma = 0.4-2.0
```
are obtained with *block* method, due to its long correlation time.
